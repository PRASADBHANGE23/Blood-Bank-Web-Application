# Blood Bank Web Application
Blood Bank Web Application created using HTML,CSS,Python,Flask Framework along with MySQL database, I have also hosted my project on pythonanywhere.com. You can visit the website through web link:http://prasad123.pythonanywhere.com/
I have provided two login on home page, one for user and another for admin.
1) Admin:
Only authorized admin can login into the system using admin login cause i have not provided the register/new user option here.
=>Options available after the successful login of admin are: 1)Add Blood bank/Blood Donor 2) Delete Blood bank/Blood Donor 3) Update Blood bank/Blood Donor 4) Show requested Blood bank/Blood Donor.
2) User:
User can login into the system using login credentials. For new user, register option is also available.
After successful login, user can search required Blood type according to their location so that user will get Blood bank/Blood Donor name, their phone number as well as their location.
